[![GitHub - Lint](https://github.com/0x6f677548/intellireading-calibre-plugins/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/0x6f677548/intellireading-calibre-plugins/actions/workflows/lint.yml)

This repo contains the source code for [Intellireading](https://intellireading.com/) Calibre plugins. These plugins allow you to generate metaguided versions of your ebooks, by implementing a streamlined version of the [Intellireading](https://intellireading.com/) algorithm, using the [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) ebook manager.


## What is Epub Metaguiding?
Metaguiding is a technique that can be used to improve your reading focus and speed (sometimes called Bionic Reading). It is based on the idea that you can use a visual guide to help your eyes focus on the text you are reading. In this case, the visual guide is done by bolding a part of the text, creating visual anchors that your eyes can use to focus on the text. This is similar to the way a finger can be used to guide your eyes along a line of text, which has been shown to improve reading speed and focus. ([study: "Does finger-tracking point to child reading strategies"](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2769/paper_60.pdf))

However, unlike a finger, the visual guide is not distracting, and it can be used to guide your eyes along multiple lines of text at once. This allows you to read faster, and with less effort.

Metaguiding is particulary useful for people with dyslexia or ADHD, but it can be used by anyone who wants to improve their reading focus and speed.
